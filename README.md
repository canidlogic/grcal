# grcal library
*Simple Gregorian calendar routines in C*

This is a small, standalone C library that provides the two core functions necessary for working with the Gregorian calendar.

All you need is to include the `grcal.h` header and compile with the `grcal.c` source file.  There are no dependencies.  See the header file `grcal.h` for documentation of the library.  There are only three functions.

The included `grcal_query.c` program demonstrates the library.  See the documentation in the source file for further information.
